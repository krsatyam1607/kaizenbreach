# Practical Helpdesk Fundamentals

These are my summarized notes from **TCM Security's Practical Helpdesk course**.  
The course focuses on IT roles, responsibilities, and real-world technical support workflows.

## What is IT?

**Information Technology (IT)** is a broad term used for different roles and groups of technologies.  
The main role of IT is to **manage and support technology required for an organization to function smoothly**.

### Key Points
- IT can be outsourced sometimes.
- IT is critical for smooth business operations.

---

## Core Responsibilities of IT

### 1. Technical Support
- Supporting employees with technical issues.
- Training users and setting up systems.

### 2. Security
- Includes **cybersecurity and physical security**.
- Protecting systems, data, and infrastructure.

### 3. Data Management
- Managing access to data.
- Ensuring proper data handling and permissions.

---

## IT Roles and Job Positions

### IT Director
- Similar to a project manager role.
- Oversees large IT projects and strategic planning.

### IT Manager
- Mostly people and operations management.
- Manages IT staff and workflows.

### Network Engineer / Network Administrator
- Designs and maintains network infrastructure.
- Handles routers, switches, and connectivity.

### System Administrator
- Manages, monitors, and administers servers.
- Handles system upgrades and asset management.

### Application Roles
- Application Manager  
- Database Administrator  
- Application Analyst  
- Solution Architect  

### Project Manager
- Project planning  
- Resource allocation  
- Budget and timeline management  
- Documentation  

---

## Helpdesk Role (Entry-Level IT Job)

### What is Helpdesk?
Helpdesk is **frontline technical support for end users**.

### Responsibilities
- Troubleshooting hardware and software issues.
- Password management.
- Customer service and communication.
- Escalating issues to higher-level teams.
- Installing and fixing hardware.
- Documentation and ticket management.

### Common Job Title
> **IT Helpdesk Level 1 / Desktop Support Technician**

This is a typical real-world entry point into IT and cybersecurity careers.

# How Computers Work (Basic Hardware & Logic)

## Transistors
- Old processors had around **3,500 transistors**.
- Modern processors contain **billions of transistors**.

---

## Logic Gates
- **Logic gates** perform calculations using binary input.
- Computers work using **0s and 1s represented by voltage levels**.

---

## Processor Input & Instruction Sets
- Instructions are sent using **high and low voltage signals**.
- **Instruction Sets** define what operations a CPU can perform.
- As processors grow complex, **instruction sets increase**.

---

## Abstraction & Compilers
- High-level languages are **abstracted from hardware**.
- **Compilers translate high-level code into machine instructions**.
- Developers don’t need to understand transistor-level logic.

# Introduction to Computing & Number Systems

## Decimal System (Base 10)
Uses digits **0–9**.

Example:
\`\`\`
163 = 1×10² + 6×10¹ + 3×10⁰
\`\`\`

---

## Binary System (Base 2)
Uses digits **0 and 1**.

Example:
\`\`\`
10100011₂ = 128 + 32 + 2 + 1 = 163₁₀
\`\`\`

---

## Hexadecimal System (Base 16)
Uses **0–9 and A–F** (A=10, B=11, … F=15)

Example:
\`\`\`
A3₁₆ = 10×16 + 3 = 163₁₀
\`\`\`

---

# Bits, Bytes & Nibbles

- **Bit** = 0 or 1  
- **Nibble** = 4 bits  
- **Byte** = 8 bits  

Example:
\`\`\`
1010 0011
|----|----|
Nibble Nibble = 1 Byte
\`\`\`

---

# ASCII Encoding

- **ASCII** is the first standardized text encoding system.
- Converts:
  - Alphabets
  - Numbers
  - Symbols  
  into binary values.

---

# Digital Data Types

- Files contain:
  - Images
  - Strings
  - Binary data
- Final stored form is always **binary instructions + data**.

---

## Key Takeaway

Computers fundamentally work using **binary logic built from transistors and logic gates**, while programming is possible due to **abstraction layers and compilers**. Understanding number systems and encoding is essential for IT and cybersecurity.
